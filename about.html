			<div id="info">
			<p>I'm currently a student at UC Berkeley majoring in business administration and media studies. I aim to land a career in advertising, with an emphasis in account management or brand strategy.</p>
			<p>I've always considered myself to be a creative whiz. I love art, writing, and music, and have been heavily involved in all three of these fields for as long as I can remember. For awhile, I was frustrated by the misconception that my creativity was limited to graphic design, journalism, or music. Getting involved in marketing, however, has allowed me to discover that there is a need for artistry beyond just the canvas or piece of paper. I use my skills now to creatively transform business strategies.</p>
